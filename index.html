<h1> Materials for Mira's MC 2019 class on probabilistic models </h1>

<h2> Day 1 </h2>

<p><a href=https://mirabernstein.github.io/probmods_mc2019/homework1.pdf>Homework #1</a><p>

<p> The homework today does not require any programming (but you should still do it). </p?>
<p> <b> Therefore, from 2:30 on, I will be in the regular TAU space and not in the computer lab. </b></p>

<p> If you want a peek at how all this looks in WebPPL, go to the 
<a href=http://webppl.org>main WebPPL webpage</a> and paste the following code in the codebox:
</p>

<pre><code>
var model = function(){
  var just_a_coin = flip(0.5)
  var q = just_a_coin? 0.5 : uniform(0, 1)
  var num_heads = Binomial({n:13, p:q})
  observe(num_heads, 10)
  return {
    just_a_coin: just_a_coin,
    q: q,
    next_outcome: (flip(q)? "H":"T")
  }
}

var opts = {method: "rejection", samples: 1000}
var posterior = Infer(opts, model)
viz.marginals(posterior)
</code></pre>

<p>Run the code and see if you understand what's happening. You can also try playing around with it (e.g. change the 10 and 13 to other values).</p>

 
<p>We'll talk lots more about WebPPL tomorrow. </p>
